<h1>Notatka</h1>
<p>
When working on this project I aimed to create a program I can use during my everyday work duties and that will make my day go smoother. 
I often find myself in a position where I have to note something quickly and then have to get back to the information in several hours. 
The Notatka, allows me to pass and save the desired information, change the location of the displayed item and delete it not only from the display 
but also from the local storage. Furthermore, I do not lose any data after refreshing the webpage. 
A clock positioned in the top right corner is a cherry on the cake and allows me to have all the information I saved along with the current time displayed.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Local Storage</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I've learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>I had an opportunity to try out possibilities given by the local storage.</li>
<li>Each of the elements at the time of creation was given a unique ID based on the current time. This allowed to identify, edit and delete the requested information.</li>
<li>Creating each note in JavaScript contributed to a neat view and only display the information required at a particular time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try out Notatka and see if you find it as useful in your everyday life as I do!</p>
